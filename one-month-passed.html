                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa ☺️</p>

                    <p>It's been one month since I opened the fan club - the time has flown by!</p>

                    <p>Thank you so much for always reading my blog and watching my projects 🫶</p>

                    <h2>A Place to Relax</h2>
                    <p>Looking back at this past month, I've been running non-stop with preparing and shooting projects, and I even got sick... It's really been hectic every day *laughs* 💦</p>

                    <p>So recently, I've been thinking "I'd love to go somewhere I can relax a bit~" and while talking with everyone through DMs and comments, you gave me various recommendations.</p>

                    <p>Among them, there were so many voices saying "Hot springs are recommended!"</p>

                    <p>Indeed, I've heard they help you recover from fatigue and improve circulation, so I thought it might be perfect for me right now! 🫶</p>

                    <h2>While Researching, I Got So Excited! ♨️</h2>
                    <p>Before I knew it, I was researching all sorts of hot spring locations, and looking at the photos made me want to go more and more...</p>

                    <p>There are outdoor baths and places where you can see beautiful scenery, and I was daydreaming like "It would be amazing to relax there~" and then somehow I ended up making a reservation... *laughs*</p>

                    <p>It's a bit sudden, but I've decided to go tomorrow! ♨️✨</p>

                    <p>I'm planning to take it as a little breather and relax ☺️</p>

                    <h2>Since I'm Going, Maybe I Can Shoot Something Too</h2>
                    <p>I feel like hot springs aren't just places to relax - they're places where you can naturally become more open and free. Since I'm going anyway, I'd love to create a "project" in that kind of extraordinary setting.</p>

                    <p>I haven't decided anything yet, but I'd like to make it so everyone can feel like they're coming to the hot springs with me 🫶</p>

                    <p>I'll report more about the details on the blog ☺️</p>

                    <h2>Reflecting on This Month</h2>
                    <p>This first month has been intense. Creating content, pushing boundaries, dealing with the physical and emotional toll of it all. There have been moments of pure joy and moments where I wondered if I was doing too much.</p>

                    <p>But through it all, your support has been constant. You've celebrated my victories, encouraged me during setbacks, and created a space where I feel safe to be vulnerable.</p>

                    <h2>The Need for Balance</h2>
                    <p>Getting sick was a wake-up call. I've learned that I can't sustain this pace without taking care of myself. Rest isn't weakness - it's necessary for longevity.</p>

                    <p>This hot spring trip feels like exactly what I need. A chance to step away, breathe, and reconnect with myself outside of content creation.</p>

                    <h2>Bringing You Along</h2>
                    <p>But even in relaxation, I can't help but think about sharing the experience with you. Not in a way that feels like work, but in a way that captures the peacefulness and beauty of the moment.</p>

                    <p>Imagine soaking in warm water, surrounded by nature, feeling completely at ease. That's the feeling I want to share if I do end up shooting something there.</p>

                    <h2>Gratitude and Anticipation</h2>
                    <p>As I look forward to this trip, I'm filled with gratitude for this first month. For every comment, every view, every moment of connection.</p>

                    <p>You've made this journey possible, and I'm excited to see where the next month takes us.</p>
