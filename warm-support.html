                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>After publishing my last blog post where I shared my true feelings, I was anxious about how people would react. But the response has been overwhelming - in the best possible way.</p>

                    <h2>You're Not Strange</h2>
                    <p>So many of you reached out with messages like "You're not strange" and "We love you even more now." I can't tell you how much those words meant to me.</p>

                    <p>I was worried that being honest about my contradictory feelings - enjoying being seen while still feeling afraid - might push people away. But instead, it brought us closer together.</p>

                    <h2>To My Fans</h2>
                    <p>I want to formally acknowledge something: you are my fans. And you are the greatest source of courage for me to take new steps forward.</p>

                    <p>My ability to continue these activities, to keep sharing, to keep growing - it all stems directly from your encouragement and support. You give me strength when I feel weak, confidence when I doubt myself.</p>

                    <h2>A Big Question: Fan Club?</h2>
                    <p>I've been receiving more and more requests about launching a fan club, and honestly, I have mixed emotions about it.</p>

                    <p>Part of me is excited. I imagine being able to share exclusive content with you, to get even closer to those who support me, to create a special space for our community.</p>

                    <p>But another part of me is terrified. What if I created one and nobody joined? What if people think it's presumptuous of me to even suggest it?</p>

                    <h2>I Need Your Input</h2>
                    <p>This is where you come in. I genuinely want to know what you think.</p>

                    <p>Would you be interested in a fan club? What would you want from it? What kind of exclusive content or experiences would make it worthwhile for you?</p>

                    <p>I'm not making any decisions yet. I want to seriously consider your feedback before moving forward with anything. Your input will help shape what comes next.</p>

                    <h2>The Power of Community</h2>
                    <p>What strikes me most about all of this is how much community matters. I started this journey feeling isolated and insecure, convinced I had to face everything alone.</p>

                    <p>But you've shown me that growth doesn't happen in isolation. It happens in connection - when we support each other, encourage each other, and create spaces where vulnerability is met with kindness.</p>

                    <h2>Moving Forward Together</h2>
                    <p>Whatever we decide about the fan club - or any other future plans - I want us to move forward together. Your voices matter. Your opinions count. This journey isn't just mine anymore; it's ours.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for being here. Thank you for your warm words, your encouragement, and your willingness to grow alongside me.</p>

                        <p>Please share your feedback in the comments or reach out via LINE. I'm genuinely interested in hearing what you think about the fan club idea and what you'd like to see in the future. Every voice matters to me.</p>
