                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa ☺️</p>

                    <p>After my last blog post, I received so many comments about my next project. Today, I want to share with you what I'm feeling right now.</p>

                    <h2>Your Feelings</h2>
                    <p>In my last blog post, I wrote:</p>

                    <p><strong>"I'm thinking about being a bit bolder in my next project"</strong></p>

                    <p>And then I received comments like...</p>

                    <p><strong>"I can't wait to see everything!"<br>
                    "To be honest, I want to see your true self even more"</strong></p>

                    <p>I received quite a few messages like these.</p>

                    <p>Of course, I had noticed from the video comments that there were people who wanted to see more. But there were far more people looking forward to it than I had expected...</p>

                    <h2>My Mixed Feelings</h2>
                    <p>So I thought I should seriously think about my next project, and I tried to work through my feelings. But I found myself caught between <strong>wanting to meet the expectations of those who support me</strong> and <strong>the anxiety of "is it really okay to show this...?"</strong> and I've been struggling with what to do...</p>

                    <p>I'm sorry for bringing it up myself and then hesitating... 😭</p>

                    <h2>Taking Time to Think</h2>
                    <p><strong>But I truly am happy that there are people who want to see more, and I do want to respond to those voices, so please give me a little more time to sort through my feelings.</strong></p>

                    <p>Once my thoughts are more settled, I'll talk about it again on the blog 🙇‍♀️</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Pressure</h2>
                    <p>I know some of you might be disappointed that I'm not giving a clear answer right now. Please understand that this decision isn't easy for me.</p>

                    <p>Your excitement and support mean everything to me. They give me courage and make me want to challenge myself. But at the same time, I need to make sure I'm comfortable with each step I take.</p>

                    <p>This isn't about not wanting to meet your expectations - it's about making sure that when I do take that next step, I'm doing it for the right reasons and with confidence.</p>

                    <h2>Moving Forward Together</h2>
                    <p>I hope you can understand that growth isn't always linear. Sometimes we need to pause, reflect, and make sure we're moving in a direction that feels authentic to us.</p>

                    <p>Your patience and understanding during this time mean so much to me. Thank you for being here and supporting me even when I'm uncertain.</p>
