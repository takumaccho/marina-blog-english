                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa!</p>

                    <p>Thank you so much for watching my third project 🫶</p>

                    <p>Today, I want to share with you some of the feedback I received!</p>

                    <h2>So Happy to Receive So Many Responses</h2>
                    <p>This project has been viewed by so many people, and the notifications about incoming feedback messages didn't stop ringing for quite a while 😳</p>

                    <p>I carefully read each and every one of them.</p>

                    <p>The most common responses I received from everyone were:</p>

                    <p><strong>"I watch it every day and it heals me" and "Thanks to you, I'm getting energy today too!"</strong></p>

                    <p>Every time I read comments like these, I'm the one receiving so much energy, and it fills me with warmth ☺️</p>

                    <h2>Words of Kindness</h2>
                    <p>Just as frequently, I receive messages like:</p>

                    <p><strong>"Please don't push yourself too hard" and "Go at your own pace"</strong></p>

                    <p>These are such gentle, caring words from people who are worried about me.</p>

                    <p>When I read them, I feel "So many people care about me this much," and it truly makes me feel blessed 🫶</p>

                    <h2>The Truth Is...</h2>
                    <p>While receiving all these kind and caring words, I have to confess something: after finishing the last photoshoot, I actually got a bit sick 💦</p>

                    <p>I think it's partly because of the changing seasons and the sudden cold weather 😭</p>

                    <p>But looking back at everything up to this point, I feel like I've been running at full speed until I released this project. I didn't think I was pushing myself too hard, but maybe my body was telling me "Hey, let's take a little break."</p>

                    <h2>Taking Time to Recover</h2>
                    <p>So I'm going to properly take care of my health and rest up before moving forward to the next step.</p>

                    <p>(I'll still do my best to keep up with my regular social media posts, so I hope you'll continue watching!)</p>

                    <h2>Learning to Listen</h2>
                    <p>This experience has taught me something important about listening to my body. I've always wanted to keep going, to keep giving you all more, to keep growing without pause.</p>

                    <p>But maybe growth also means knowing when to rest. Maybe taking care of myself is part of being able to continue this journey with all of you.</p>

                    <p>Your messages telling me not to push too hard - they've taken on new meaning now. You were seeing something I wasn't ready to see yet.</p>

                    <h2>Gratitude</h2>
                    <p>I'm so grateful for every single message. The ones that gave me energy, the ones that made me smile, and especially the ones that reminded me to take care of myself.</p>

                    <p>You've created such a supportive space where I can be honest about both my victories and my vulnerabilities. That's incredibly precious to me.</p>

                    <h2>Moving Forward Mindfully</h2>
                    <p>I promise to take this recovery time seriously and to listen to what my body and mind need. When I come back, I want to come back stronger and healthier.</p>

                    <p>This isn't goodbye or a long break - just a pause to breathe and recharge. Your support makes even this possible.</p>
