                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa.</p>

                    <p>Today, I want to announce my Halloween project to everyone!</p>

                    <h2>I Shot It!</h2>
                    <p>Remember the Halloween project I mentioned in my last blog post? Well, I completed the photoshoot recently!</p>

                    <p><strong>I wore three cute cosplay outfits, and I even rented a stylish photoshoot studio, so I was feeling really excited ☺️</strong></p>

                    <p>By the way, about which cosplays I did...</p>

                    <p><strong>① The cosplay I showed in my last blog post (the fluffy one that looks like a cat? A wolf? That one!)<br>
                    ② Maid outfit<br>
                    ③ Apron look</strong></p>

                    <p>These are the three 🫶</p>

                    <p>As for the maid and apron outfits, the costumes were quite daring... 😳</p>

                    <p>On the day of the shoot, my excitement and energy were so high that as I kept filming, I thought <strong>"I want to show everyone even more,"</strong> and I got more and more bold *laughs*</p>

                    <h2>It Became an Over 1-Hour Work</h2>
                    <p>Because of that, this project, just like the last one, shows <strong>"my true self, as I am."</strong></p>

                    <p>However, since I tried cosplay this time, it became quite a different work from the last one ☺️</p>

                    <p><strong>I hope you'll get excited watching me gradually go from cosplay to "full nudity" 🫶</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>And the total recording time for this work is over 1 hour! ✨</strong></p>

                    <p>During filming, I really got into it and ended up shooting a lot *laughs*</p>

                    <p>I feel like I was more relaxed than last time, and I think my expressions and atmosphere are more natural!</p>

                    <h2>The Journey Through Three Costumes</h2>
                    <p>Each costume represents a different aspect of playfulness and vulnerability. Starting with the fluffy cat/wolf costume - cute and fun, then transitioning to the classic maid look with its own charm, and finally the apron ensemble.</p>

                    <p>What made this shoot special was how my confidence grew throughout the process. Each costume change felt like shedding a layer of hesitation, becoming more comfortable with being seen.</p>

                    <h2>More Relaxed, More Natural</h2>
                    <p>One thing I'm really proud of with this project is how much more relaxed I felt compared to my previous shoots. When you're more comfortable, it shows in your expressions, your body language, your energy.</p>

                    <p>I wasn't just performing - I was genuinely enjoying myself. And I think you'll be able to feel that joy when you watch it.</p>

                    <h2>Over an Hour of Content</h2>
                    <p>I honestly didn't plan for it to be this long! But once I got started, the creative energy just flowed. I wanted to capture every angle, every transition, every moment of the journey from cosplay to my natural self.</p>

                    <p>This is my longest project yet, and I poured so much into it. I hope the length doesn't feel excessive - instead, I hope it feels like a complete experience, a full story.</p>

                    <h2>Releasing Tomorrow!</h2>
                    <p><strong>I'm releasing this Halloween work tomorrow! ✨</strong></p>

                    <p>I hope you're looking forward to it ☺️</p>

                    <p>Since it's Halloween...</p>

                    <p><strong>If you don't watch, I'll have to play a trick on you~! (Just kidding, of course *laughs* ☺️)</strong></p>

                    <h2>A Different Kind of Vulnerability</h2>
                    <p>This project feels different from my previous work. Yes, it's still about showing my authentic self, but the journey through costumes adds a layer of storytelling that wasn't there before.</p>

                    <p>It's about transformation, about shedding not just clothes but also inhibitions, about discovering confidence through play and creativity.</p>

                    <h2>Gratitude</h2>
                    <p>Creating this made me realize how far I've come. From someone who was afraid to be seen to someone who can express themselves this freely - that journey has been possible because of your support.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for making it safe for me to be this vulnerable, this playful, this authentically myself.</p>
