                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa.</p>

                    <p>I mentioned in my last post that I got a bit sick after the recent photoshoot, but I'm feeling much better now, so I decided to write today's blog ☺️</p>

                    <h2>About My Health</h2>
                    <p>Thank you so much to everyone who sent me concerned messages 🫶</p>

                    <p>I touched on this in my last blog post, but I want to reaffirm that <strong>"moving forward without pushing myself, continuing at my own pace"</strong> is something I want to prioritize.</p>

                    <p>Why do I feel this way? <strong>"Because I want to keep my social media and fan club activities going for as long as possible, and I want to do so with energy and health!"</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>"That's why I want to take proper care of my body and mind, and continue my activities without rushing."</strong></p>

                    <p>From now on, I'll gradually get back to my rhythm so that I can continue bringing energy to all of you ☺️</p>

                    <h2>Halloween Is Coming Soon</h2>
                    <p><strong>"I just realized Halloween is coming up soon ☺️"</strong></p>

                    <p>The streets are gradually becoming Halloween-themed, and just walking through those areas makes me feel a bit excited *laughs* 🎃</p>

                    <p>Since it's the season, I'm thinking it would be nice to share "Halloween-themed content" on the fan club too *laughs* (Like cosplay maybe? *laughs*)</p>

                    <h2>Finding Balance</h2>
                    <p>This recent experience has taught me something valuable about sustainability. It's not just about creating content - it's about creating a rhythm that I can maintain.</p>

                    <p>I love sharing with all of you. I love the connection we've built and the community we're creating together. And because I love it so much, I want to make sure I can keep doing it for a long time.</p>

                    <p>That means being honest when I need rest, listening to my body's signals, and not measuring my worth by how much or how quickly I produce content.</p>

                    <h2>The Halloween Spirit</h2>
                    <p>I'm really excited about Halloween this year! There's something magical about this season - the way it encourages playfulness and creativity.</p>

                    <p>I've been thinking about what kind of Halloween content would be fun to create. The idea of cosplay has been bouncing around in my mind. It would be something different, something playful, and hopefully something that would make you all smile.</p>

                    <p>I'm still in the planning stages, but I wanted to share my excitement with you. Your anticipation gives me energy!</p>

                    <h2>Moving Forward Together</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for being so understanding and patient. Your supportive messages reminded me that it's okay to prioritize my health, that taking care of myself isn't selfish - it's necessary.</p>

                    <p>I'm feeling recharged and ready to continue this journey with you, just at a pace that feels sustainable and healthy.</p>

                    <p>Let's keep growing together, one step at a time, at our own pace.</p>
