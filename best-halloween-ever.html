                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa ☺️</p>

                    <p>Thank you so much to everyone who watched my Halloween project 🫶</p>

                    <p>Once again, I received so many comments, so please let me share some with you!</p>

                    <h2>I'm Glad I Did Cosplay ☺️</h2>
                    <p>Once again, I received so many warm comments from everyone 😭</p>

                    <p>"So cute!" "The Halloween costumes were amazing!" "It healed me!"</p>

                    <p>Receiving so many comments like these made me incredibly happy ✨</p>

                    <p>Actually, there were messages like this too:</p>

                    <p><strong>I was truly surprised that it reached people overseas... I couldn't believe it 😳</strong></p>

                    <p>Being seen by people beyond Japan like this - it might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it really moved me 😭</p>

                    <p>And I thought, going forward, <strong>I hope I can bring energy to even more people through my work!</strong> *laughs*</p>

                    <h2>For Those Who Haven't Seen It Yet 👀</h2>
                    <p><strong>The Halloween project will be available until tomorrow! 🎃</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Before you miss it, I'd really love for you to check it out 🫶</strong></p>

                    <p>I'm also looking forward to hearing which cosplay you liked best ☺️</p>

                    <h2>Reaching Beyond Borders</h2>
                    <p>When I started this journey, I never imagined my work would reach people around the world. The internet has this amazing ability to connect us across distances and cultures.</p>

                    <p>Knowing that someone on the other side of the world took time to watch my content, to leave a comment, to connect with what I created - that's an incredibly humbling feeling.</p>

                    <h2>The Power of Feedback</h2>
                    <p>Every comment I receive isn't just feedback - it's validation that being vulnerable was worth it. Each "cute!" or "this healed me" reminds me why I took those scary first steps toward sharing myself.</p>

                    <p>Your words give me courage to keep going, to keep creating, to keep pushing my boundaries just a little bit further.</p>

                    <h2>Halloween Magic</h2>
                    <p>There was something special about creating Halloween content. The playfulness of the holiday, the permission to dress up and transform, the collective celebration - it all added an extra layer of joy to the project.</p>

                    <p>I hope that joy came through in what you watched. I hope you felt how much fun I was having, how liberating it felt to embrace different characters and costumes.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>This Halloween project has shown me that there's an appetite for different kinds of content, for themed shoots, for creative exploration within this journey of mine.</p>

                    <p>I'm already thinking about what might come next. Not rushing, not forcing it, but letting ideas percolate and seeing what feels right.</p>

                    <h2>Gratitude Overflowing</h2>
                    <p>I keep saying thank you, but I really mean it. Your support has transformed my life. You've given me a space to be authentic, to explore, to grow.</p>

                    <p>The fact that this resonates with people across languages and cultures makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself.</p>
