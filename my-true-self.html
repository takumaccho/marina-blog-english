                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa ☺️</p>

                    <p>Today, I completed the photoshoot for my third project that I mentioned in my last blog post!</p>

                    <h2>Tomorrow, It Will Be Released!</h2>
                    <p>Tomorrow, I'll be releasing my third project!</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned in my previous blog post, this project shows <strong>"my true self, completely natural, without anything on."</strong></p>

                    <p>And this time, instead of photos, I filmed a video!</p>

                    <p>I tried filming scenes where I talk by myself and share my thoughts...</p>

                    <p>In the end, it turned into a video that's over 30 minutes long, but I worked really hard on it, so I hope I've created something that everyone will enjoy... *laughs*</p>

                    <h2>There's Still Anxiety</h2>
                    <p>Of course, my anxiety hasn't completely disappeared.</p>

                    <p>I still have some fears about "how people will feel when they see it," but more than that, <strong>my desire to "take another step forward and respond to everyone's feelings" is stronger right now!</strong></p>

                    <p>I'd be so happy if you could watch it and share your thoughts with me!</p>

                    <h2>This Was a Big Step</h2>
                    <p>This project represents something significant for me. It's not just about the content itself, but about what it symbolizes in my journey.</p>

                    <p>When I started sharing my story, I never imagined I'd reach this point. Each step has built on the previous one, and your support has made every single step possible.</p>

                    <p>There were moments during the shoot when I felt nervous, moments when I questioned myself, but there were also moments when I felt incredibly free and authentic.</p>

                    <h2>The Filming Experience</h2>
                    <p>Filming this video was different from taking photos. Speaking to the camera, being in motion, staying present for an extended period - it all required a different kind of vulnerability.</p>

                    <p>But it also allowed me to express myself in ways that photos couldn't capture. I could share my thoughts directly, talk about my feelings in real-time, and let you see more of who I really am.</p>

                    <p>The 30+ minutes ended up including so much - moments of reflection, moments of nervousness, and moments where I just tried to be completely myself.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward to Your Response</h2>
                    <p>Your feedback has always been so important to me. It's what has given me courage at every stage of this journey.</p>

                    <p>Whether your response is surprise, understanding, encouragement, or just curiosity - I want to hear it all. Your honest reactions help me understand myself better and give me strength to continue growing.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for reading to the end ☺️</p>

                    <p><strong>Please look forward to tomorrow's release!</strong></p>

                    <p>I'll send the announcement through LINE.</p>

                    <p>If you haven't registered yet, I'd really appreciate it if you could add it now 🫶</p>
