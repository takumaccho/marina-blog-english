                    <p>Hello everyone, it's Risa ☺️</p>

                    <p>Today, I want to talk about the "next project" I mentioned in my last blog post. I've had time to sort through my feelings, and I'm ready to share my decision with you.</p>

                    <h2>I've Made My Decision</h2>
                    <p>I've spent a lot of time reflecting on everything - your comments, my fears, my desires, and what feels right for me.</p>

                    <p>To get straight to the point: <strong>I've decided to give it a try... *laughs*</strong></p>

                    <p>After reading all your comments and thinking deeply about it, I realized something important. The fan club is a space where I can share parts of myself that I might not be ready to show elsewhere. It's a safe community where I feel supported and understood.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Changed My Mind</h2>
                    <p>In my last post, I talked about my anxiety and uncertainty. Those feelings were very real, and they haven't completely disappeared. But what shifted for me was understanding that growth doesn't mean waiting until all fear is gone.</p>

                    <p>Your supportive messages reminded me why I started this journey in the first place. You've accepted me at every stage, and that acceptance has given me courage.</p>

                    <p>I kept thinking: "These people have supported me through everything. They've never judged me. Maybe this is exactly where I can take this next step safely."</p>

                    <h2>The Upcoming Photoshoot</h2>
                    <p>I'll be doing a photoshoot soon for this new project.</p>

                    <p><strong>Honestly, I don't even know exactly what it will be like. I can't fully imagine how I'll feel during the shoot. But I'm going to put all my feelings - everything I've experienced on this journey - into it and give it my absolute best!</strong></p>

                    <p>This feels different from my previous projects. There's more vulnerability, more authenticity, and yes, more nervousness. But there's also more determination.</p>

                    <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
                    <p>Once the photoshoot is complete and everything is ready, I'll announce the release through LINE to my fan club members.</p>

                    <p>If you haven't registered for LINE notifications yet, please consider doing so. That's where I'll share all the important updates about this project first.</p>

                    <h2>A Personal Note</h2>
                    <p>I know I have a tendency to overthink things and hesitate when making decisions. I've gone back and forth on this more times than I can count.</p>

                    <p>But this time, I feel confident that this is <em>my</em> decision. Not something I'm doing just because people want it, but something I'm choosing for myself as part of my growth.</p>

                    <p>I'm scared. I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm determined. All of these feelings are true at the same time, and I'm learning that's okay.</p>

                    <h2>Thank You</h2>
                    <p>It took a bit of courage to write this post and make this announcement. But knowing you'll be there supporting me makes it possible.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for being patient with me while I figured this out. Thank you for your encouragement. Thank you for creating a space where I feel safe to take these risks.</p>

                    <p>Let's take this next step together.</p>
